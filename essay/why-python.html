    <h1>Why I Chose Python as My First Programming Language</h1>

    <p class="article-meta">
        Selin Shahi · Computer Science · 2024
    </p>

    <p>
        As a first-year computer science student, I have come to realize that the digital
        world is far more sophisticated than what we perceive in our daily lives. Computers
        have become indispensable across nearly every discipline, serving as the backbone
        of modern industries and research. In essence, much of our world now revolves around code.
    </p>

    <p>
        This realization motivated me to explore the field of programming more deeply. For my
        first programming language, I chose Python due to its simplicity, readability, and
        close resemblance to human language.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this article, I outline the reasons why Python is an excellent starting point for
        beginners in computer science and present a practical project I developed using
        Python and a relational database — a Library Management System.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Python is a Great First Language</h2>

    <h3>1. Simplicity</h3>
    <p>
        Python is known for its clean and intuitive syntax, which closely resembles natural
        language. This simplicity allows beginners to grasp fundamental programming concepts
        more easily compared to many other languages.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Abundant Learning Resources</h3>
    <p>
        Python offers a vast ecosystem of tutorials, documentation, and educational materials,
        ensuring that learners at every level can find guidance.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Versatility of Applications</h3>
    <p>
        Python is widely used across domains such as algorithms, artificial intelligence,
        database management, web development, and data analysis.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Strong Career Prospects</h3>
    <p>
        Python consistently ranks among the most in-demand programming languages worldwide,
        creating strong academic and professional opportunities.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning Algorithms with Python</h2>

    <p>
        Algorithms form the foundation of problem-solving in computer science. Python’s
        readability allows students to focus on logic and design rather than syntax complexity.
    </p>

    <div class="code-box">
<pre><code>
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1

numbers = [10, 25, 30, 45, 50]
result = linear_search(numbers, 30)

if result != -1:
    print(f"number in index found: {result}")
else:
    print("The number doesn’t find")
</code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>
        This example demonstrates a simple linear search algorithm, helping beginners
        understand basic iteration and condition checking.
    </p>

    <h2>Library Management System Project</h2>

    <p>
        The sample project presented in this article is a Library Management System developed
        using Python and MySQL. It allows users to manage books and library members efficiently.
    </p>

    <div class="code-box">
<pre><code>
class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, year):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.year = year

    def info(self):
        return f'{self.title} - {self.author}, ({self.year})'
</code></pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Programming Language:</strong> Python</li>
        <li><strong>Database:</strong> MySQL</li>
        <li><strong>Library:</strong> mysql-connector-python</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        Learning Python as a first programming language provided me with a strong foundation
        in computer science concepts and the confidence to apply them in practice.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project represents my first complete application and serves as a valuable
        portfolio project demonstrating how theoretical knowledge can be translated into
        functional software.
