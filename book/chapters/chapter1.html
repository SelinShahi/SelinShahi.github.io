  <p>
    Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to intelligence demonstrated by machines,
    in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans.
  </p>
  <p>
    AI is a branch of computer science whose primary objective is to develop
    intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that typically require
    human intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
    In essence, artificial intelligence involves the simulation of human
    cognitive processes by computers. An AI system is designed to think,
    reason, and imitate human behavior in order to solve problems and
    learn from experience.
